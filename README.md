# MMOP
There are the functions and truePSPFs of the imbalanced distance minimization problems (IDMP), the multimodal multi-objective test functions (MMF), the imbalanced distance minimization benchmark problem with epsilon efficient solutions (IDMP_e) and Polygon-M problems.

The codes use PlatEMO (v3.4) published in "Ye Tian et al., PlatEMO: A MATLAB Platform for Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization, IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, 2017, 12(4): 73-87".
